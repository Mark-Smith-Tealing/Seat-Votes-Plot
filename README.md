# Seat-Votes-Plot

This code was created as part of my 4th year mathematics project on the topic of partisan gerrymandering in the United States of America. A Seats-Vote-Plot, as shown below, has on the axes the vote share and seat share in a state. We start with a realised election outcome (the black dot on the plot) and we modify the vote count in each district uniformly. The steps in the plot represent points where a district flips from the democratic party to the republican party or vice versa. Therefore, the curve represents all hypothetical election outcomes that could have occurred under any possible vote.

Below, is the seats-vote plot for the 2020 house of representatives election in Virginia from the Democratic Party's perspective. In this election, the Democratic Party won 7 of the 11 available districts with a vote share of 52.4%, this is the black dot in the figure.

The SeatsVotePlot function has two arguments, arrays a_votes and b_votes where a_votes are the Democratic Party votes and b_votes are the Republican Party votes per district in the state. The output is a step function curve generated by uniform partisan swing. Included are functions EfficiencyGap and SymmetryMeasures that calculate gerrymandering measures mentioned in the following references. For a brief introduction to partisan symmetry and the efficiency gap, please see [1]. For a detailed discussion of partisan symmetry and the derivation of the seats-votes curves, see [2] and for a detailed discussion of the Efficiency Gap, see [3].
