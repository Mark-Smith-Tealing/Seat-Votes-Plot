# Seat-Votes-Plot
This is code for my 4th year mathematics project. I thought it would be useful to share as it would have helped me greatly at the start of my project.

The code takes as input two arrays, a_votes and b_votes where a_votes are the democrat votes and b_votes are the republican votes per district in the state. The output
is a matplotlib graph of the step function given by the method of uniform partisan swing. Included are functions EfficiencyGap and SymmetryMeasures that calculate the gerrymandering measures mentioned in the following references. For a brief introduction to partisan symmetry and the efficiency gap, please see [1]. For 
a detailed discussion of partisan symmetry and the creation of the seats-votes curves, see [2] and for a detailed discussion of the Efficiency Gap, see [3].
