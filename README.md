# Seat-Votes-Plot
This is for a mathematical project that I am completing. I thought it would be useful to share as it would have helped me greatly at the start of my project. 
So here it is for anyone else looking for something similar. 

The code takes as input two arrays, a_votes and b_votes where a_votes are the democrat votes and b_votes are the republican votes per district in the state. The output
is a matplotlib graph of the step function given by the method of uniform partisan swing. If you wish to read more about this see [1] and [2].
